Asset management is a critical part of every organization's security plan. Asset management is the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them. Effective asset management starts with creating an asset inventory, or a catalog of assets that need to be protected. Then, it involves classifying assets based on their level of importance and sensitivity to risk.
